# Numerical-Computation
The repository contains solution to steady-state heact conduction PDEs.The equation are solved using explicit(2D-FDM explicit.py) and implicit(2D-FDM implicit solver.py) apprach. The PDEs are modelled using finite difference method and then solved further. The implict apprach solves the set of linear equation using Gauss-siedel method to avoid the problem of sparse matrix.
