The repository contains solution to steady-state heat conduction PDEs as well as 2D-transient heat conduction by the name of T2dHC solver (with multi-independent point BCs and domain inversion) .The equation are solved using explicit(2D-FDM explicit.py) and implicit(2D-FDM implicit solver.py) approach. T2dHC solver (with multi-independent point BCs and domain inversion) is solved using implicit approach .The PDEs are modelled using finite difference method and then solved further. The implict apprach solves the set of linear equation using Gauss-siedel method to avoid the problem of sparse matrix.

T2dHC solver will require a little learning on how to operate,therefore I comments guide you of what to change and what not to set your desired Boundary conditions values. But if then also anyone is not able to operate the solver so feel free to contact me at nabeelhasan661@gmail.com.

More new updated and advanced version with user friendly system of editing BCs will be uploaded in near future.ðŸ˜€
